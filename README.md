# DataKitFall2024
Here we have three analyses I did in the context of DataKind's Fall 2024 DataKit event, that was focused on the housing crisis in the US.

Every analysis consists of RMD and html files targeting Orange County in Florida, plus another RMD file where I generalized that analysis to all counties in the State via shiny modules.

The data frames I used are described in the relevant files.
